Cells may become cancerous due to the accumulation of defects, or mutations, in their DNA. Certain inherited genetic defects  and infections can increase the risk of cancer.
Most of the time, cells are able to detect and repair DNA damage. If a cell is severely damaged and cannot repair itself, it usually undergoes so-called programmed cell death or apoptosis. Cancer occurs when damaged cells grow, divide, and spread abnormally instead of self-destructing as they should.
A tumor is an abnormal mass of cells. Tumors can either be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign Tumors grow locally and do not spread. As a result, benign tumors are not considered cancer. They can still be dangerous, especially if they press against vital organs like the brain.Malignant Tumors have the ability to spread and invade other tissues. This process, known as metastasis, is a key feature of cancer. There are many different types of malignancy based on where a cancer tumor originates.<br> 
 The literature abounds with the information about genes implicated in various cancer types which has been gained through a variety of high-throughput Databases like PharmGKB, TherapeuticTargetDatabase, Uniprot, Pubchem, NCBI etc. However the information is rather sporadic.Cancer DrugDatabase is a repository of Drugs and Genes with detailed description about indication of drug with respect to the cancer type and the genes responsible for the disease also gives information about the involvement of drug in the cancer
